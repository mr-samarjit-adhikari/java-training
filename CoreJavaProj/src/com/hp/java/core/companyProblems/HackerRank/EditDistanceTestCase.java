/**
 * Objective: Given two strings, s1 and s2 and edit operations (given below). Write an algorithm to find minimum number operations required to convert string s1 into s2.
 *
 * Allowed Operations:
 *
 *     Insertion – Insert a new character.
 *     Deletion – Delete a character.
 *     Replace – Replace one character by another.
 *
 *     Example:
 * String s1 = "horizon"
 * String  s2 = "horzon"
 * Output: 1  {remove 'i' from string s1}
 *
 * String s1 = "horizon"
 * String  s2 = "horizontal"
 * Output: 3  {insert 't', 'a', 'l' characters in string s1}
